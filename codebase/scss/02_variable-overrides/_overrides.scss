// VARIABLE OVERRIDES

/*
How to override the default variables:
--------------------------------------

(1.) Simply copy whichever of the default variables you wish to override into
`_overrides.scss`.
(2.) Change the variable value.
(3.) Remove the `!default` flag from your overrides.

IMPORTANT: When incorporating an update of Codebase into an older Codebase 
project, be sure to:

FIRST, copy your overrides; 
SECOND, replace the older Codebase with the newer version;
THIRD, add your overrides in again.

Then figure out what changes you need to make in order to accommodate the
new Codebase (the log file should inform you of the changes).
