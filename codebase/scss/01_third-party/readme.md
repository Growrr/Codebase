# Converting CSS to SCSS partials

In order to `@import` third-party CSS into a SCSS project, it must first be converted into a SCSS file. Sebastian Pontow has a free "css2scss" converter online at [http://sebastianpontow.de/css2compass/](http://sebastianpontow.de/css2compass/).

### Normalize

This css2scss converter has been used to generate the partial herein named `_normalize.scss` from Nicolas Gallagher's `normalize.css` version 4.1.1 for importing into Codebase.

See [https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/4.1.1/normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/4.1.1/normalize.css)
