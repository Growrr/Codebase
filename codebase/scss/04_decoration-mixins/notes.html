<p>// DECORATION MIXINS: NOTES
// ========================</p>

<p>/*</p>

<p>Decoration mixins are not necessary because decoration classes can simply refer to the decoration variables in <code>01_variables/_decoration.scss</code>. And any utility or component can also simply refer to the decoration variables therein.</p>

<p>In this folder (<code>02_mixins-decoration/</code>) you may develop mixins as composites various decoration variables, e.g. to build simple card utilities or message boxes.</p>

<p>For example: in the Codebase docs I have build simple info boxes such as:</p>

<div class="initial-icon deco-bl-thick-solid deco-b-primary deco-p-md deco-bg-silver">
  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up deco-text-primary"></i> <b>Hat tip:</b>...
</div>

<p>These deco classes all refer to deco variables, and the <code>initial-icon</code> class includes the <code>initial-icon</code> mixin. So these could have been combined thus:</p>

<p>.message-box&#8211;primary {
 border-left: $border-thick-solid;
 border-color: $color-primary;
 background: $color-silver;
 @include initial-icon;
 &gt; i:first-of-type {
 color: $color-primary;
 }
}</p>
