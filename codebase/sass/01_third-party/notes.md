# Converting CSS to SCSS partials

In order to `@import` third-party CSS into a SCSS project, it must first be converted into a SASS file. Example: [https://css2sass.herokuapp.com](https://css2sass.herokuapp.com).

### Normalize 5.0.0

This css2scss converter was used to generate the partial herein named `_normalize.sass` from Nicolas Gallagher's `normalize.css` for importing into Codebase.

See [https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/5.0.0/normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/5.0.0/normalize.css)
