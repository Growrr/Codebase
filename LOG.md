# Codebase Version Log

### v.1.2 - 26 August 2016

* Changed the default media query breakpoint widths to:
	*	 xs = 320px
	*	 sm = 640px
	*	 md = 960px
	*	 lg = 1280px
* Changed the swatch secondary color to teal (was gray). Now the grayscale and the secondary color don't overlap.
* Added a horizontal version of the menu component, and also named it as `menubar`. Therefore the collapsing menubar component has been renamed as `navbar`.
* Split the Codebase JS into partials.
* Improved the usefulness of the Codebase docs by implementing tabs into which the actual SCSS and JS (jQuery) partials are loaded.
* Moved the visibility (show/hide) mixins and classes from Utilities to Layout. And rebuilt mixins and classes.
* Using the [Prism](http://prismjs.com/) syntax highlighter in the Codebase docs.
* Updated the base font stack.
* Added a simple slideshow component.
* Improved the `modal` (now also named as `popover` and `lightbox`, for more versatility). Designers can style these differently from each other.
* Smaller line-height for h1-h4 base typography.
* Set the size of tabs labels using `$deco-spacing-block`, so as to be to be the same size as menus and navbar elements â€“ and so that the tabs on a "tabbed menubarbar" look consistent with the menubar block links.
* Various bug fixes.

### v.1.1 - 5 August 2016

* Various minor bug fixes/ snagging following v.1.0 repo sync.
* **Removed the "CSS-only scroll-lock"**: it was preventing iOS Safari toolbars from hiding/minimizing while scrolling (because iOS Safari does this on body scroll, whereas the Codebase v.1.0 scroll-lock scrolled the page inside of a `div.body--inner` instead of allowing body scroll). But this now means that page scrolling can happen behind revealed modals and behind revealed off-canvas sidebars.
* Solved the problem of modals appearing _behind_ the darkened reset-overlay on iOS Safari - by removing `position:relative` from the containing grid and columns.
* Added a `-light` variant of the color swatch and `deco-` classes.
* **Overhauled Codebase jQuery scripts**: transformed the functions into plugins, and moved them out of the master `$(document).ready()` function (also now a plugin), so that developers can include them in their own theme/app script going forward.
* Abbreviating mixin names and class names):
  * `tiny, small, medium, large` has become `xs, sm, md, lg` (in grid systems and in decoration classes)
  * `breakpoint__` has become `break__`
  * `column` has become `col`
  * `button` has become `btn`
* Adding `col-` prefix to some grid system class names bring them into accord with BEM. E.g. `col col-sm--span-6` (was `column small--span-6`).
* Reflecting these changes in the docs.
* `margin-bottom` has been removed from form elements. Now you don't have to overrive it when you don't need it.


### v.1.0 - 27 July 2016

* Major improvement of all code to bring it (mostly) into accord with BEM naming principles (grid system not according to BEM).
* Added a few more components (e.g. modals, off-canvas sidebar).
* Improved consistency of styling by creating decoration variables and classes.
* Made a big start on the docs.
